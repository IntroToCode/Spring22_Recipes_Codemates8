# Duck Confit

## Servings: 5

## Time to prepare: 1.5 hours

## Ingredients: Duck, lentils, onions carrots, shallots, thyme, salt, pepper, orange


## Equipment needed: sous vide, dutch oven


## Steps for preparation:
Cure duck for 12 – 24 hours in a dry cure of salt, herbs and spices;

Submerge in duck fat, cook in oven for 8 hours at a very low temperature. We use a small pan to minimise the amount of duck fat required, and I usually slow cook overnight;

Crisp skin in a hot oven, using a rack set over a pan of boiling water to keep the flesh on the underside moist. This is a far more effective and easier method than the usual pan-frying or broiling/grilling called for in most recipes.

Place duck in a snug roasting pan: Place duck in a small metal roasting pan with high sides in which they fit snugly, touching each other, but in a single layer. The pan I use is 27cm x 21cm (10.5″ x 8″);

You need a pan with high sides so hot duck fat doesn’t slosh out when you handle it – hot fat and hands don’t mix! It’s best if it’s a metal roasting pan so you can put it straight on the stove to kickstart the fat heating step (step 3 below);

Cover with duck fat: Pour fat over duck legs. You need enough so they are virtually fully submerged. A little bit of the skin or bone above the surface is fine because the duck will shrink under as it cooks. The main aim here is to ensure the flesh is fully submerged;

Heat fat: Place the pan directly on the stove over medium-high heat until the fat is bubbling energetically across the whole surface (ie not just around the edges);

Cover with paper: Turn the stove off. Cover the duck with baking/parchment paper cut to size so it sits flat on the oil surface. Press it gently down to remove air bubbles.

This paper lid is a cooking technique similar to a cartouche which is used to trap heat and keep foods submerged during braising or confit like this.

Cover the pan tightly with a double layer of foil. Now you’re ready for slow roasting!

Slow-cook: Carefully transfer to the oven. (Be very careful! Hot duck fat is dangerous!) Slow-cook for 8 hours at 100°C / 210°F (80°C fan). I typically do this overnight. In an oven this low, I feel perfectly safe snoozing away!

Remove from oven: This is what it looks like when it comes out of the oven. It will look totally unimpressive with pale and flabby skin. But just wait! The best is yet to come!

Check flesh is cooked: By this stage, the duck flesh should be ultra-tender and “fall apart at a touch” but still attached to the bone. There’s two ways to check:

Pair it with some wine.
