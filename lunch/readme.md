Ham and Turkey Club

## Servings: 5 servings 


## Time to prepare: 8 minutes

## Ingredients: 8 slices of wheat/multigrain bread; 1 lbs of ham; 1 lbs of turkey; 1/2 lbs of swiss cheese; 1 head of red leaf; 1 tub of mayo; 1 tomato; bacon  


## Equipment needed: toothpicks; knife, napkins


## Steps for preparation:
First Layer: Do not spread the mayo on one side of lightly toasted bread (I don't like mayo). Add turkey, tomato and cheese (be sure to put the tomatoes in the middle so the bread doesnâ€™t get soggy).
Second Layer: Layer ham, bacon and lettuce.
Top with the final slices of bread, secure with cute sandwich picks and cut into quarters. 
Serve with pickles or chips. Maybe even some iced sweet tea!


### Notes: Enjoy!
